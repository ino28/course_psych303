### Purpose of Course

Educational psychologists work to understand how to structure
educational systems in order to meet the cognitive and affective needs
of students. They study how people learn and develop, identify and
suggest efficient teaching methods, and evaluate the effectiveness of
various educational policies and practices. Below are a few examples of
their matters of focus:
-   Educational psychologists often point out the inherent social nature
    of our current educational system. Particularly at the elementary
    level, education involves responding to social instructions just as
    much as it does learning new academic material. Most of the books
    that children read not only assist them in learning basic skills,
    but also convey some sort of moral or social lesson. Teachers spend
    much of their time focused on social instruction and management.
-   Educational psychologists study the ways that learning environments
    affect education. A child entering the education system must adjust
    to a new environment and a new set of rules and goals while also
    undergoing many personal changes in body and mind. Educational
    psychology provides us with the tools we need to understand these
    changes and adaptations.
-   Educational psychologists also study the ways that societal, local,
    and family issues affect learning and classroom practice. Children
    come to the classroom with various attitudes about schooling, about
    teachers, and about goals and possibilities. They come from many
    different socio-economic situations, parenting styles, and cultural,
    religious, and political traditions. Educational psychologists are
    experts who help educators understand this diversity.

Generally speaking, Educational Psychology has two major areas of focus:
education theory, and the practicalities of classroom life. This course
will attempt to blend those two areas of focus as often as possible, so
that you—as the reader, student, and (future) teacher—can get the most
out of the material.
